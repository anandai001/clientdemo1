  <div><strong>Summary:</strong><br>**THEM:**
Anand (meaning "happiness" or "bliss") is a certified Soul Healing Practitioner and Tao Healing communicator under Master Sha’s line. Having overcome trauma, self-doubt, and disconnection, he now channels higher‑dimensional light to help others heal on soul‑level.

**THEIR CLIENTS:**
Individuals facing blocks in health (physical, mental, emotional, spiritual), relationships, finances, or overall life satisfaction, who feel stuck despite previous efforts.

**SOLUTIONS:**
- **Soul Healing Blessings**: 30-minute sessions (online/in-person near Harrow) to clear root-cause negative soul patterns, with guidance for self-practice.
- **Soul Light Connection Classes**: Teaching techniques to stay aligned with soul-light and upliftment.
- **Soul Readings**: 15–30-minute soul-history consultations to receive clarity and healing guidance from high-level light beings.
- **Free Digital Empowerment Companion**: A self-reflection coaching tool to raise awareness and prompt action.

**UNIQUE APPROACH:**
Works as a conduit for “higher-dimensional light” from soul/spiritual realms (via Tao Healing modalities and lineage from Master Sha). Blends channelled spiritual wisdom with self-empowerment practices.

**RESULTS:**
Clients report relief from fear, pain (emotional or physical), feeling lighter, peaceful, and empowered to take action; many describe transformative shifts in their lives.

**THEIR TONE:**
Warm, encouraging, spiritual, reflective, grounded in personal experience. Invites clients to “taste” the transformation and start their journey from a place of light and possibility.
